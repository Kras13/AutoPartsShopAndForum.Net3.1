# AutoPartsShopAndForum
The application is built on ASP.NET Core MVC. The main function of the system is to provide an application that can be used for buying parts for cars. In order to provide more auto parts-specific functionallity and efficiency, there is a forum section where people can create new forum posts, answer and ask questions about auto parts. Online chat support is available using SignalR. Email send support available, too.
