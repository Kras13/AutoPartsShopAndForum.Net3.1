# AutoPartsShopAndForum
The application is built with `ASP.NET Core MVC`. The main function of the system is to provide an application that can be used for buying parts for cars. In order to provide more auto parts-specific functionallity and efficiency, there is a forum section where people can create new forum posts, answer and ask questions about auto parts. Online chat support is available using SignalR. Email send support available, too.
